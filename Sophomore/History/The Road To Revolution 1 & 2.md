## Part 1

- After the French and Indian War, London had to pay a large war debt
	- During this time, George III was made king
	- George III didn't like Whigs (people who opposed the monarchy) and wanted to restore power to the monarchy
	- The Whigs had a stable coalition, but when GIII became king, he removed them from power and made his own unstable coalition
	- Each minister of the new unstable government only lasted like 2 years
	- George III was severely disabled psychologically and mentally
	- George Grenville (prime minister appointed by king) was somehow more responsible for problems with the colonies instead of George III 
- The Three Fires Confederacy had a long history (get it) of fighting back against the Europeans
	- The British gave them blankets with smallpox on them, causing many Native Americans to die
	- Proclamation Of 1763 stated that no settler can travel past the Appalachian Mountains
	- Paxton Boys were a racist group of frontiersmen that killed 20 Conestoga
	- White violence, illness, supply shortages, and internal divisions caused the end of the native people revolt
	- Proclamation of 1763 eventually got dismissed cus George Washington thought it was lame (Called it a "temporary expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians")
- Currency Act of 1764 by the British required colonial assemblies to stop issuing paper money
	- Sugar Act prevented exports of timber and iron to countries other than Britian, and reduced duty on French molasses to prevent smuggling
	- Mutiny Act of 1765 required colonists to help provision and maintain the British Army
	- Small civil war broke out because "Regulators" (farmers) resisted against the taxes
- Stamp Act of 1765 imposed by Grenville caused detrimental effects to the colonists by taxing all printed documents. This allowed the British to collect 10x more revenue from the colonists
	- Patrick Henry created the Virginia Resolves which states that colonists could only be taxed by their own representatives, that colonists have the same rights as the British, and other things
	- Sons of Liberty and other mobs rose up against the Act

	- The Marquis of Rockingham repealed the Stamp Act, but he also established the Declaratory Act which granted Parliament power over the colonists in any and all cases
## Part 2

-  Colonies resented the Townshend Duties, which applied tax on external items instead of internal (lead, paint, paper, tea)
	- Boston was angry because the Duties stopped the smuggling business, this led to a Boston boycott of all the items the Townshend Duties put a tax on 
	- After Charles Townshend died, the Duties were repealed 
- The harrassment of customs officers got really bad in Boston.
	- dockworkers, liberty boys, and others pelted the sentries at the customs house
	- some confusion led to British soldiers shooting and killing 5 of the rioters, called the "Boston Massacre" by the locals
	- Samuel Adams attempted to make a "committees of correspondence" in order to publicize grievances against Britain
- British political philosophy called for three classes/elements of society: Monarchy, Aristocracy, and the people.
	- Some evidence suggests colonists were less mad about the actual taxation, but about the lack of representation behind it
	- Though this was the case, things like Parliament were not made to have members from all parts of the empire, but to represent the empire as a whole, this is called "virtual representation" Colonists also practiced this
- Pamphlets of resistance were often distributed in places where political discuss occurred in the colonies, particularly in taverns and the likes

	- 3 groups of 50 masked men went aboard British ships and threw their tea into the harbor. This was called the Boston Tea Party
	- The Coercive Acts closed the Boston ports, reduced the Massachusetts self-government power, allowed royal officers in America to be tried for crimes in other colonies or in Britain, and made the colonists quarter British troops. This was known as the Intolerable Acts in America
	- 51 women signed to their "sincere adherence" to anti-British resolutions and to support the public good
